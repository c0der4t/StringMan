# StringMan

One of the first, small but personally great, projects in my portfolio. Kept private until now.

Stringman is a small and easy utility that I use on a daily basis. 
A similar repo of mine FileLineEditor is based on Stringman, infact it was a mutation built for a client.

Stringman is easy to use, just add some text into the input field, define some prefix and suffix and in one click you get the altered version of the text.
